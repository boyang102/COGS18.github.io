### Materials

All course materials are openly available and downloadable from this website, but we highly recommend following along in class with a live notebook so you can try the programs we talk about as we talk about them. To get your own live copy of the notebooks and follow along in lecture by clicking the "click me to synchronize" link in the syllabus for the course you are enrolled in. This GitHub repo[^1] updates every lecture, so **you will have to click on this link every lecture to keep your DataHub up to date**.

[^1]: Git and Github are tools used by many programmers. Git is version control software that helps you keep track of changes in your code as you work on it. GitHub is a web platform (using Git) for working on your code by yourself, working on your code with other programmers, and sharing your code once it is ready to be used. The source material for everything hosted on this site is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/COGS18). While we don't explicitly teach you to use GitHub in this class, you should definitely explore it on your own if you're interested!
